Reading through [Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) (which is an excellent book I might add), I decided do some of the algorithms in there and put them here.

I have implemented in python:
* Binary Search
* Linked Lists
* Quick Sort
* Breadth-First Search
* Dijkstra's Algorithm for Traversing Weighted Graphs
